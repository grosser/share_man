  #  ==> Model specific configuration
  # Keep in mind that *all* configuration blocks are optional.
  # RailsAdmin will try his best to provide the best defaults for each section, for each field!
  # Try to override as few things as possible, in the most generic way. Try to avoid setting labels for models and attributes, use ActiveRecord I18n API instead.
  # Less code is better code!
  # config.model MyModel do
  #   # Here goes your cross-section field configuration for ModelName.
  #   object_label_method :name     # Name of the method called for pretty printing an *instance* of ModelName
  #   label 'My model'              # Name of ModelName (smartly defaults to ActiveRecord's I18n API)
  #   label_plural 'My models'      # Same, plural
  #   weight -1                     # Navigation priority. Bigger is higher.
  #   parent OtherModel             # Set parent model for navigation. MyModel will be nested below. OtherModel will be on first position of the dropdown
  #   navigation_label              # Sets dropdown entry's name in navigation. Only for parents!
  #   # Section specific configuration:
  #   list do
  #     filters [:id, :name]  # Array of field names which filters should be shown by default in the table header
  #     items_per_page 100    # Override default_items_per_page
  #     sort_by :id           # Sort column (default is primary key)
  #     sort_reverse true     # Sort direction (default is true for primary key, last created first)
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the list view
  #   end
  #   show do
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the show view
  #   end
  #   export do
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the export view (CSV, yaml, XML)
  #   end
  #   edit do
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the edit view (for create and update view)
  #   end
  #   create do
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the create view, overriding edit section settings
  #   end
  #   update do
  #     # Here goes the fields configuration for the update view, overriding edit section settings
  #   end

# All fields marked as 'hidden' won't be shown anywhere in the rails_admin unless you mark them as visible.
# There can be different reasons for that:
#  - belongs_to _id and _type (polymorphic) columns are hidden in favor of their associations
#  - associations are hidden if they have no matchable model found (model not included or non-existant)
#  - they are part of a bigger plan in a plugin (Devise/Paperclip) and hidden by contract
# Some fields may be hidden depending on the section, if they aren't deemed suitable for display or edition on that section
#  - non-editable columns (:id, :created_at, ..) in edit sections
#  - has_many/has_one associations in list section (hidden by default for performance reasons)
